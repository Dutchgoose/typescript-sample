# Typescript Sample - Lookout JS

This is a typescript sample project. The code was used as part of a defunct Open Source 3RD party API monitoring service.

The sample docs page is here - [docs.withlookout.com](https://docs.withlookout.com/getting-started)

Take a look around!

The library is in `src/lib` with the main logic for the application inside of `lookout.js`

The tests are in:
`src/text/lookout`


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
